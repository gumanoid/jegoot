data flow:
args -> test app -> output lines -> test results (+ test output!) -> list of failed tests (maybe empty)
complication 1: test interruption by user -> state 'interrupted or not' (in another thread!)
complication 2: only 'current' test output is shown -> state 'current test name'
complication 3: args can be passed via UI or command line

???
- what is 'queued' state? am I supposed to retrieve list of tests without running them?
- seems that output line can change to reflect test state (queued/working/failed/passed)
